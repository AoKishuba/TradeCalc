Instructions
  Setup and First Run
    ItemList
        Skip to “CityList” if you are not using any mods which add items to the game.

        By default, the optimizer uses a list of trade goods from the vanilla game. Each item included on the list fulfils the following criteria:
     - The item sells for full price (excludes food items, weapons, and armor)
     - The item can be bought from a vendor (excludes artifacts, loot from ruins, &c)

        If you would like to add items – for example, from a mod – it is crucial that you do the following before doing anything else with the optimizer:
    1. Run TradeCalc.exe once. The first time the program is run, it should display the message “itemList.json not detected. Using default item list.”
    2. Close TradeCalc.exe
    3. In the TradeCalc directory, open the file “itemList.json”
    4. Add the item
      a. Name: Display name as shown in-game, IN QUOTES
      b. InventorySize: Width * Height, in inventory squares
      c. StackSize: Number of items which can fit into the same space
      d. ItemWeight: Weight in kg
      e. LocalPrice: 0
      f. LocalMarkup: 0
      g. ID: Exactly the same as the Name property above
        As an example, here is the entry for the vanilla Advanced First Aid Kit:
     {
       "Name": "Advanced First Aid Kit",
       "InventorySize": 6,
       "StackSize": 1,
       "ItemWeight": 2,
       "AveragePrice": 265,
       "LocalPrice": 0,
       "LocalMarkup": 0,
       "ID": "Advanced First Aid Kit"
     },

    5. Save itemList.json and restart TradeCalc.exe
    6. Delete the default city “New City” which was created the first time TradeCalc was started

    Your items should appear in any cities you create from this point forward. Note that items are not added retroactively: if you add any items to itemList.json later
    on, you will have to delete and re-add any already-existing cities and update all prices for those cities.
    
  CityList
    When the optimizer is run for the first time, no “cityList.json” file will be present. This is expected; the optimizer will respond by creating a new file with a
    blank city named “New City” and instructing the user to rename the city. See below for how to do this.

Menu Options
  0: Add city
      Adds a city with the given name. Cities cannot have duplicate names.
  1: Delete city
      Deletes the selected city. Enter ‘none’ to exit without deleting anything.
  2: Change name
      Renames the selected city with the given name. Cities cannot have duplicate names.
  3: Edit price list
      Brings up the trade good list of the selected city for updating.
  4: Optimize trade
      Compares prices in the given source and destination cities and shows the profit per inventory square of every item. Note that only positive profits are shown,
      and only for items which have non-zero prices in both the source and destination cities (items with prices of 0 are assumed to have simply not been updated by
      the user).
